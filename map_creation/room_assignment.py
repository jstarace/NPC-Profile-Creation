"""
Generates randomized 5x5 dungeon layouts with entrance and exit placement.

Creates procedural dungeons by randomly assigning room descriptions and
ensuring entrance/exit are not adjacent. Produces one of ~5.7Ã—10^14
possible map configurations.

Key constraints:
- Entrance and exit cannot be adjacent rooms
- All 25 rooms get unique description IDs
- Random placement with collision avoidance

Returns a 3D array structure: [row][column][description_id, encounter_id, loot_id]
where encounter_id and loot_id are initially set to 'None' and populated
by separate assignment functions.
